         <p>During this Quarantine I did 3 Buisiness Projects, that had to do with
            Covid-19. These projects contained information like, the Buisiness rates and the economy
            rates during this Pandemic.</p>

        <p>I also worked on Chemistry. Chemistry is one of the most hardest classes right now
            because there is a lot of work we get. The teachers also explained how it is easier to
            teach at school because us students are struggling to get the help we need through online. 
            Not going to school has made it harder for us to learn especially because we don't have
            the one on one help.
